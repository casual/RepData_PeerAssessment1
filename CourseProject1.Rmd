###Loading and preprocesing the data

We read the data and remove the NAs cases:

```{r cache = TRUE}
rawdata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
ok <- complete.cases(rawdata)
cleandata <- rawdata[ok,]
cleandata$date <- factor(cleandata$date)
```

###What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

The total number of steps taken per day is given by:

```{r}
total_steps <- tapply(cleandata$steps,cleandata$date,sum)
(total_steps)
```

Now we make a histogram of the total steps:

```{r}
hist(total_steps, col = "green")
```

Finally, we take the *mean* and *median* of the total number of steps:

```{r}
mean(total_steps)
median(total_steps)
```
